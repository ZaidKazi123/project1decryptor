the construction of manhattan's subway system began in the early 1900s as a response to overcrowded streets and the need for rapid transit. engineers faced immense challenges, including dense urban infrastructure and the island's bedrock. workers used the cut-and-cover method for many sections, digging trenches along busy avenues and covering them after laying tracks. tunnels were reinforced with steel and concrete to handle vibrations and weight. thousands of laborers, many immigrants, worked in harsh conditions with limited safety measures. the first line, operated by the interborough rapid transit company, opened in 1904, running from city hall to 145th street. this project transformed urban mobility, enabling faster commutes and shaping the city's growth. despite technical hurdles and political battles, the subway became a symbol of modern engineering and remains vital to new york's identity.
