BENEATH THE STONE BRIDGE, HIDDEN BEHIND MOSS AND SHADOWS, LAY A DOOR FEW HAD SEEN. IT OPENED TO A STAIRCASE SPIRALING DOWN TO A VAST UNDERGROUND LIBRARY. SHELVES STRETCHED ENDLESSLY, FILLED WITH BOOKS BOUND IN LEATHER AND CLOTH, THEIR PAGES YELLOWED BY TIME. THE RIVER ABOVE MUFFLED ALL SOUND, CREATING A SILENCE SO DEEP IT FELT ETERNAL. THE LIBRARIANS WERE GHOSTS OF MEMORY, MOVING WITHOUT FOOTSTEPS, PRESERVING WORDS NO LONGER SPOKEN. ONE EVENING, A TRAVELER STUMBLED UPON THE DOOR AND DESCENDED. HE READ UNTIL HIS LANTERN BURNED OUT, THEN STAYED, UNABLE TO LEAVE THE WEIGHT OF FORGOTTEN KNOWLEDGE. THE RIVER FLOWED ON, UNAWARE OF THE STORIES BENEATH.
