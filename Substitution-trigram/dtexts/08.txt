IN A NARROW ALLEY, A CLOCKMAKER WORKED TIRELESSLY ON A DEVICE UNLIKE ANY OTHER. HIS SHOP SMELLED OF OIL AND BRASS, AND GEARS LAY SCATTERED LIKE FALLEN LEAVES. HE BELIEVED TIME WAS NOT LINEAR BUT LAYERED, AND HIS INVENTION WOULD PROVE IT. THE MECHANISM WAS INTRICATE: CONCENTRIC RINGS, EACH MOVING AT A DIFFERENT RHYTHM. NEIGHBORS THOUGHT HE WAS ECCENTRIC, BUT HE IGNORED THEM. ONE WINTER MORNING, THE CLOCK STOPPED TICKING, AND THE MAKER VANISHED. YEARS LATER, THE DEVICE WAS FOUND IN AN ATTIC, STILL HUMMING FAINTLY. SOME SAY IT BENDS SECONDS INTO HOURS, OTHERS CLAIM IT HIDES A SECRET DOORWAY. NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE, BUT THE LEGEND OF THE CLOCKMAKER ENDURES.
