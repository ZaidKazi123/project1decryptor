ON A HILL OUTSIDE A QUIET TOWN STOOD AN ABANDONED OBSERVATORY, ITS DOME RUSTED AND ITS TELESCOPE COVERED IN DUST. DECADES AGO, IT WAS THE PRIDE OF LOCAL ASTRONOMERS, WHO MAPPED STARS AND TRACKED COMETS. NOW, IVY CRAWLED UP ITS WALLS AND THE GEARS INSIDE WERE FROZEN. ONE NIGHT, A CURIOUS STUDENT CLIMBED THE HILL WITH A FLASHLIGHT AND A NOTEBOOK. SHE PUSHED OPEN THE HEAVY DOOR AND FOUND SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY WIND. AS SHE WIPED THE LENS, THE SKY REVEALED A METEOR SHOWER BLAZING ACROSS THE DARKNESS. SHE SCRIBBLED NOTES, REALIZING THE OBSERVATORY STILL HAD PURPOSE. THE FORGOTTEN DOME BECAME HER SECRET REFUGE, A PLACE WHERE OLD MACHINES WHISPERED STORIES OF INFINITE SKIES.
