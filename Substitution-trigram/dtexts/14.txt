IN THE MIDDLE OF AN APPLE ORCHARD STOOD A MACHINE NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN. IT WAS TALL, MADE OF COPPER AND GLASS, HUMMING SOFTLY AS IF ALIVE. FARMERS AVOIDED IT, FEARING ITS GLOW AT NIGHT. ONE AUTUMN, A CHILD APPROACHED AND PRESSED A BUTTON. THE MACHINE WHIRRED, AND APPLES BEGAN TO FALL IN PERFECT RHYTHM, FORMING PATTERNS ON THE GROUND. SCIENTISTS CAME, MEASURING ITS PULSES, BUT FOUND NO LOGIC IN ITS DESIGN. SOME BELIEVED IT PREDICTED SEASONS, OTHERS THOUGHT IT SPOKE TO THE EARTH. WHEN WINTER ARRIVED, THE MACHINE WENT SILENT, COVERED IN FROST. SPRING RETURNED, AND SO DID ITS HUM, REMINDING EVERYONE THAT NOT ALL MYSTERIES DEMAND ANSWERS.
