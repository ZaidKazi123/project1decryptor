the enigma machine, a german rotor cipher, mixed letters through shifting wiring and a plugboard, yielding vast keyspaces. daily keys and message procedures guarded secrecy, yet operator habits leaked patterns. allied analysts combined math, crib-finding, and polish insights, building electromechanical bombes to test permutations. bletchley park turned signals into intelligence, shortening the war and proving computation plus rigor can pierce layered secrecy without brute force.
